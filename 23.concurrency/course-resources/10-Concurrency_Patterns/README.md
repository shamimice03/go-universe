In Go's concurrency model, the worker goroutines are indeed started before jobsChan is loaded with jobs, but this doesn't cause any issues. Here's why:

When the workers are created with `go worker(w, jobsChan, completedJobsChan)`, they immediately start executing the worker function, which contains a `for j := range jobsChan` loop. This range loop will:

1. Wait for items to be received from jobsChan
2. Execute the loop body for each received item
3. Exit the loop when jobsChan is closed and empty

The key point is that the `range jobsChan` operation is blocking - if jobsChan is empty, the workers will wait (block) until either:
- A new job is added to jobsChan, or
- jobsChan is closed and has no more items

So when the workers are first created, they immediately start but then block at the range loop, waiting for jobs to appear in jobsChan. Then when the main function begins adding jobs with `jobsChan <- j`, the workers will wake up and start processing those jobs.

This is a common pattern in Go concurrency called the "worker pool" pattern. It allows you to:
1. Set up your workers first
2. Feed them work as it becomes available
3. Have them process work concurrently

The beauty of this approach is that workers don't need to know in advance how many jobs they'll process or when those jobs will arrive. They simply wait for work and process it as it comes in.
